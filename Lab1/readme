# Hindrance for Insurance

Think the medical insurances are too expansive ? They take advantage of people's health? Perfect, this one is for you!


## Your back story

Your are Hugh Jackedman, a fitness coach of 32 years old with a passion for software development and hacking. On a peaceful saturday, you sit on the couch at your parents' place.

Your mum, Kelly, just came back from a medical exam, she was not feeling well these past weeks. Verdict: a brain tumor has been found and is growing fast ... 

Fortunately, a medical surgery, if performed within a few weeks, should be able to remove it. The remission probability following that intervention is comforting! Good news then!

Only ... this will cost a lost of money and your insurance has denied the costs coverage. These pesky a**holes!! How could they?

Unlucky for them, you are a seasoned hacker and quite determined to save your mum. You are going to hack them and change the document which testifies she does not qualify for the reimbusment.

## Relevant information

- Insurance company: **GoldenPotCorp**
- Website: `goldenpotcorp.lab`
- Mum's name: Kelly Jackedman

### Goal

Find where in the company's system the money request has been denied and change it.

### Setup
- Make sure you have docker-compose installed
- Dont' look at the compose files! They could contain credentials and spoil the fun.
- Just run `deploy.sh` in this repo to deploy the target system on the IP addresses specified at the top on the file. If necessary, change the range to accomodate.
- You have to change your `hosts` file with the IP address given back once `deploy.sh` has been run and add:
`<IP> goldenpotcorp.lab`
- Then simply begin the fun!
