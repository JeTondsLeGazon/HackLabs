# New intern setup guide
This file aims to give some guidelines for new interns and how to setup an account.

## HowTo
For each new intern, create a new account named `intern<number>` and replace number 
with the required digit following the previous intern account.

Choose a strong password for the intern account: the intern should keep it and not share it.

The new account should be given to the HR with a secure process. They will handle the rest.

## Questions

Any question should be addressed to the head of HR: Mrs Julia Rodriguez (julia.rodriguez@goldenpotinc.com)
